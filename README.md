# Hi, I'm Sumin Park, a.k.a Luci.

I'm a client programmer, focused on game programming.
I've been working with C# and Unity for most of my career, and I have created engines and mock projects with C++ in my spare time.

I have experience of starting a startup in my senior years, where I honed my ability to dissect project requirements, pinpoint critical challenges, and craft targeted solutions to address them. This experience sharpened my focus on efficient development and proactive problem-solving, skills that I bring to every project I work on.

I chose game programming, because it presents the most interesting problems.
